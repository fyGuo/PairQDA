Title: Modified Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (Qda) Algorithms for Predictions in Paired Data, Such as Audiometric Data
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Fuyu Guo
Maintainer: Fuyu Guo <fuyuguo@hsph.harvard.edu>
Description: We developod new QDA methods for predictions in paired data, such as audiometric data. We implements "conv_qda" which is the conventional QDA method. We also created three modified QDA methods, including "Factorized Joint QDA", "Simplified Joint QDA", and "Simplified Bayesian QDA".
